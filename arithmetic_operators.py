# first we have addition
print(2+6)

#then also subtraction
print(40-6)

#then multiplication
print(30*2)

#then we have two types of division
#this one returns a number with decimalpoint if necessary

print(100/3)
# this one returns a whole number
print(100//3)

#we also have modulus, returns the remainder of a division
print(10%3)

# we have the exponent operator i.e to raise to the power of
print(22 ** 4)

# we have the assignment operator also
x= 10
# then we have the enhanced/augmented assignment operator, here we're adding 3 to 13
x+=3
# python's operator precedence is same as maths i.e BODMAS, but we can always override it using parentheses/brackets i.e
y = 10 + 3 * 2
print(y)
#to over ride it and make it execute addition first, we do
y = (10 + 3) * 2
print(y)
