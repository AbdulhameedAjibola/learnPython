# in python, we can import more functions/code from the library .
from math import *


# the pow functions allows to raise a number to the power of whatever parameter is passed
print(pow(3, 5))
# the abs function is used to return the absolute value of a number
number = -45
print(abs(number))
# this function allows us to print the bigger of two numbers
print(max(44, 7))
# this function is used to print the lesser of two numbers
print(min(5, 6))
# the round functions allows us to round up/down a number
print(round(3.6))

# so now that we have imported the more math functions from the library, lets check out a few of them
# the floor method, rounds the number down to a whole number, no matter what is after the decimal point
print(floor(456.7555))
# the ceil method, does the exact opposite of the floor method
print(ceil(44512.2))

# the SQRT method, to get square root of a number
print(sqrt(55))
